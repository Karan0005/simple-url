## ‚ö° Quick Start Guide

### Prerequisites:

Ensure that you have the following installed:

-   [Node.js (>= 20.17.0)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager)
-   [Redis (>= 7.0.0)](https://redis.io/)
-   [Mongo (>= 8.0.0)](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)
-   [Visual Studio Code (Recommended)](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)
-   [Docker Desktop (Optional)](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)

### Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the project dependencies using the following command:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    This will:

    - Validate your Node.js and npm versions.
    - Install recommended VS Code extensions.
    - Create an environment file from the sample if one does not exist.

3. Run the project using Docker (optional):

    ```bash
    npm run docker:up
    ```

    This is optional, you can run the project even without Docker:

    - Use `npm run frontend:serve` command to run **frontend**.
    - Use `npm run backend:serve` command to run **backend**.

### Frontend Commands

-   **Build**: Builds the frontend project after prompting for the environment.

    ```bash
    npm run frontend:build
    ```

-   **Unit Tests**: Runs unit tests for the frontend.

    ```bash
    npm run frontend:test
    ```

-   **E2E Tests**: Runs E2E tests for the frontend.

    ```bash
    npm run frontend:e2e
    ```

-   **Serve**: Serves the frontend project after prompting for the environment.

    ```bash
    npm run frontend:serve
    ```

### Backend Commands

-   **Build**: Builds the backend project.

    ```bash
    npm run backend:build
    ```

-   **Unit Tests**: Runs unit tests for the backend.

    ```bash
    npm run backend:test
    ```

-   **E2E Tests**: Runs E2E tests for the backend.

    ```bash
    npm run backend:e2e
    ```

-   **Serve**: Serves the backend project.

    ```bash
    npm run backend:serve
    ```

### Upgrade Project Dependencies

There is a custom script to upgrade all project dependencies. If an error occurs during the upgrade,
the script will automatically rollback the changes.

```bash
npm run upgrade
```

### Generate module for frontend or backend

This custom script streamlines the creation of new modules for either frontend or backend projects.
It prompts the user for input on module and component/controller names, generates the necessary
files and directories.

```bash
npm run generate:module
```

## üîß Environment Variable Guide for New Variable

1. **Local Development**

    Set up environment variable in a `.env` file.

2. **Local Development with Docker**

    Set up environment variable in both the `.env` file and `docker-compose.yml`.

3. **Dev, UAT, Prod Environments**

    Configure environment variable within CI/CD pipeline files.

**Note**: Depending on the project requirements, you may also need to configure environment variable
in the backend or frontend configuration files.

## üìã Sample Environment Variables

Below is a sample `.env` file. This file should not contain sensitive or production-specific values.
For real environment variables, ensure they are managed securely.

```env
# ====================== DISCLAIMER =======================
# This file is a sample configuration for environment variables.
# It should be committed to version control to provide a reference
# for required variables and their names. However, it should not
# contain sensitive or production-specific values.
#
# The actual `.env` file should contain real values and must be
# added to .gitignore to prevent it from being tracked in the
# repository. Ensure that sensitive information is securely managed
# and kept private.
# =========================================================
